**ABOUT ME**  
I have been coding since I was 11, it was at that age that I discovered that we could write things that made our lives easier or had a greater impact.  
Since then I have been CTO of a website development company using Shopify for online stores.  
And one day maybe I'll live in Canada \*my dream\*
